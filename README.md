# Pre-work - tips

tips is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: tips

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [X] User can edit tip percentages from 10%-25%
- [X] Red/Blue color themes (not that pretty though)
- [X] Constraints added

## Notes

Creating the delegate to make edits to my viewController from my settingsViewController was pretty hard, but I found this nice useful youtube video on it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEvOYG-xB54
